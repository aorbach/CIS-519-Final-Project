# CIS-519-Final-Project

This repository contains the CIS 519 Final Project code for Amiel Orbach, Brian Perriello, and Nicholas Pilotti, along with a copy of our final report. It is written in Python using PyTorch to implement a GAN, which consists of discriminator and generator networks used to generate images that can imitate various datasets. Due to randomization, results from running the code may not accord with the results appearing in the final report. Restarting it several times with different random state initialization could lead to favorable results, but no result is guaranteed.
