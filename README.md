# CIS-519-Final-Project

This repository contains the CIS 519 Final Project code for Amiel Orbach, Brian Perriello, and Nicholas Pilotti. It is written in Python using PyTorch to implement a GAN, which consists of discriminator and generator networks used to generate images that can imitate various datasets. Due to randomization, results from running the code may not accord with the results appearing in the final report. Try to restart it several times with different random state initializations, but no result is guaranteed.
